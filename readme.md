# Home Lab

### Introduction
This is a quick ramble about my home lab.


I used William Lam (https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/home-lab) site alot to help choose my hardware. I'd recommend his site and following him on Twitter if you're interested on home labs, loads of good information.

### Delivery has arrived!
A couple of pictures of the hardware before I started to unbox it.
